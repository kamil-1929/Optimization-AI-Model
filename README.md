# Production Scheduling Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing the production schedule for a factory that manufactures five different products (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5). The goal is to maximize total profit while adhering to constraints on resource availability and production capacities.

## Problem Statement

The factory produces five products, each requiring different amounts of labor, machine time, and raw materials. The goal is to maximize total profit while considering constraints related to resource availability and production capacities.

## Solution Approach

We use Linear Programming (LP) to solve this optimization problem. The PuLP library in Python is utilized to model and solve the LP problem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` files.

### Installing

#### Using `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
